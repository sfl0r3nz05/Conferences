## Introduction

The roaming procedure maintain persistent connectivity of the subscribers across different networks and geographical regions. Roaming refers to the capability for a subscriber to access the mobile services offered by the Visited Public Mobile Network (VPMN) via the Home Public Mobile Network (HPMN), when moving out of the coverage range of HPMN [1]. However, before ensuring persistent connectivity the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must reach an agreement regarding the technical, commercial and legal relationships.
